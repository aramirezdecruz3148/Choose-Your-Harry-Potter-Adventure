            <p id="description">It is late at night and your best friend dares you to sneak out of the castle and go 
                    to the Shrieking Shack by yourself. Not wanting to let them see how scared you are, you 
                    agree and try to shrug it off as you leave your house dorm. The walk to the Shrieking 
                    Shack is long and eerily silent this time of night. It has been so silent that your ears
                    perk up the second you arrive and open the door, as you are greated with several load bangs. 
                    Trying to be braver than you feel, you get your wand out, and proceed inside. You hear
                    an evil cackle coming from above your head and look up just in time to see Peeves 
                    materialize with a bucket of water that he unceremoniously dumps on your head. You are now
                    wet, cold, and angry! You look back up at Peeves and the wide grin spreaking across his
                    face REALLY adds insult to injury. Your anger boils over and you have an overwhleming
                    desire for revenge. What do you do?</p>
